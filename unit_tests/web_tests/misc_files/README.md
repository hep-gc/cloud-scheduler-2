# Miscellaneous Files Directory

This is a directory for putting a variety of non-code files for the web interface tests. This includes logfiles (\*objects.txt), image files (\*.hdd), and key file downloads (*.pem).

All files in this directory except *.md files are in the .gitignore. Any files that need to be committed should remain in the web_tests directory. Files that should not be committed should be put in this directory.

As part of the setup, the user will need to add several files to this folder. Others will be added as the tests are run. Any that are added by the tests can be deleted without causing problems, but the ones that are manually added should not be deleted.
