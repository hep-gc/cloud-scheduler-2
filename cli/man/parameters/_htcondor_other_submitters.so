\fB\-htcu\fI comma-separated-list-of-users\fR, \fB\-\-htcondor-other-submitters \fIcomma-separated-list-of-users\fR
Specifies a list of users in addition to group members that are allowed to submit jobs to your HTCondor job queue.
When scanning job queues, cloudscheduler version 2 (csv2) will only select jobs whose requiments specify
a csv2 group and whose owners are associated with corresponding csv2 groups. All other jobs will be ignored.
This option allows the addition of users who have submit but no other csv2 privileges.
