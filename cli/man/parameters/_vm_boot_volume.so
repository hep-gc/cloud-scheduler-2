\fB\-vbv \fI<JSON_dictionary string>\fR, \fB\-\-vm-boot-volume \fI<JSON_dictionary string>\fR
Specifices whether a boot volume is to be created for VMs instantiated on this cloud or not.
If a boot volume is to be created, then the <JSON_dictionary string> should contain at least one, but may contain more than one,
of the following key/value pairs:

.IN +5
o "GBs": n
.br
o "GBs_per_core": n

Where "n" is an integer number of gigabytes. If a key/value pair is omitted, the corresponding value is assumed to be zero.
The size of the boot volume is calculated as: GBs + (GBs_per_core * flavor_cores).

Example: {"GBs_per_core": 10}

To erase an existing specification and use the boot disk provided by the flavor, the <JSON_dictionary string> must be erased
by specifying "null" (without the quotes).
