            <p>This web page provides additional CSV2 components for installation on remote hosts. Each component
            listed is configured to interact with this CSV2 host. The following downloads are available:

            <h3>1. Condor Poller.</h1>
            <p>Each CSV2 instance can service one or more HTCondor job schedulers, each running on its' own 
            host and each with it's own instance of the CSV2 condor poller. It can be installed on HTCondor
            hosts by running the following commands as root:

            <div class="div_inner">
                cd /tmp <br>
                wget <a href="https://{{ ansible_fqdn }}/repo/condor_poller.tar.gz">https://{{ ansible_fqdn }}/repo/condor_poller.tar.gz</a><br>
                tar -xzvf condor_poller.tar.gz<br>
                rsync -av cloudscheduler /opt
            </div>

            <p>When these steps have been completed, the condor poller service will need to be enabled. If you
            are replacing an old installation or redirecting to a new CSV2 server, first disable the old service
            as follows:

            <div class="div_inner">
                /opt/cloudscheduler/utilities/service_disable_condor_poller
            </div>

            <p>To enable the new service:

            <div class="div_inner">
                /opt/cloudscheduler/utilities/service_enable_condor_poller
            </div>

            <p>If your HTCondor job scheduler is using GSI authentication, then you will need to ensure the correct 
            condor poller configuration in the file <b>"/opt/cloudscheuler/etc/cloudscheduler/condor_poller.yaml"</b>.
