Database View: view_condor_host
===============================

This view is one of a suite of related views used by
the cloud pollers, HTCondor machine poller and User Interface (UI) processes to
ensure that resource usage on clouds remains within allocated quotas and user
defined limits. The suite includes:

#. view_condor_host_

#. view_vm_kill_retire_over_quota_

#. view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age_

#. view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle_

.. _view_vm_kill_retire_over_quota: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_views/view_vm_kill_retire_over_quota.html

.. _view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_views/view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age.html

.. _view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_views/view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle.html

The view_condor_host is used by the HTCondor machine poller when retiring Virutal
Machines (VMs) to provide contact details so that commands can be sent
directly to VMs. The view also provides slot counters to ensure that
target VMs are in an appropriate state to receive retirement commands.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the cloud hosting the VM.

* **dynamic_slots** (Integer):

      Is the count of dynamic slots. A value greater than zero indicates
      that jobs are still running on the VM.

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning the VM.

* **hostname** (String(128)):

      Is the short hostname of this VM.

* **htcondor_fqdn** (String(128)):

      Is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the job scheduler containing
      the VMs registration.

* **machine** (String(256)):

      Is the HTCondor machine name for this VM.

* **primary_slots** (Integer):

      Is the count of primary slots. A value greater than zero indicates
      that the VM is still registered with HTCondor and is able to
      be retired.

* **retire** (Integer):

      Is the current value of the VM's retire flag. A value greater
      than zero indicates that the retirement process has already been initiated.

* **retire_time** (Integer):


* **retiring** (Integer, obsolete):

      Is the current state of the HTCondor daemons on the VM. Retirement
      commands will continue to be sent to the VM until this field
      reflects that they are 'retiring'.

* **terminate** (Integer):

      Is the current value of the VM's terminate flag. A value greater
      than zero indicates that the termination process has already been initiated.

* **updater** (String(128)):

      Indicates which process last updated eithe the retire or terminate flage and
      what the nature of the update was.

* **vmid** (String(128)):

      Is the unique ID of this VM.
