Database View: view_apel_accounting
===================================

This view pulls information from three tables:

* apel_accounting

* cloud_flavors

* cloud_images

To present complete VM accounting information in a form suitable for presentation
and for processing by external systems.

The primary information source, **apel_accounting**, maintains an accounting record for each instantiated
VM. The records are initially created by a database trigger, **trigger_apel_accounting_add_vm**, when
the CSV2 VM scheduler instantiates a VM and creates its entry in
the **csv2_vms** table. Subsequently, updates arrive from the VM via the **csv2_vm_data**
poller. The record for any particular VM is completed by a second
database trigger, **trigger_apel_accounting_del_vm**, following the termination of the VM and the removal
of its record from the **csv2_vms** table. Finally, **apel_accounting** records considered obsolete,
those whose last update was more than the configurable value **apel_accounting_keep_alive_days** ago,
are deleted by the **csv2_vm_data** poller.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the CSV2 group that owns the VM.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the cloud that hosted the VM.

* **vmid** (String(128)):

      Is the unique ID of the VM.

* **hostname** (String(128)):

      Is the short VM hostname.

* **cloud_type** (String(32)):

      Is the type of cloud hosting the VM.

* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the region within the cloud where the VM ran.

* **flavor_id** (String(128)):

      Is the ID of the flavor used to instantiate the VM.

* **image_id** (String(128)):

      Is the ID of the (kernel) image used to instantiate the VM.

* **benchmark_type** (String(32)):

      Is a string identifying the type of benchmark being used to calibrate
      the performance of the VM

* **benchmark** (Integer):

      Is the benchmark score achieved by the VM.

* **start_time** (Integer):

      Is the time the VM was instantiated.

* **end_time** (Integer):

      Is the time the VM was termintade. If NULL, the VM is
      still running and producing accounting information.

* **last_update** (Integer):

      Is the time the VM accounting record was last updated.

* **cpu_time** (Integer):

      Is the number of cpu seconds that have been consumed by the
      VM.

* **network_type** (String(32)):

      Is a string indicating the type of network assigned to the VM
      at instantiation time.

* **rx** (Integer):

      Is the number of megabytes received by the netwoork.

* **tx** (Integer):

      Is the number of megabytes transmitted by the netwoork.

* **flavor** (String(128)):

      Is the name of the flavor corresponding to the flavor ID.

* **cores** (Integer):

      Is the number of cores offered by the flavor.

* **disk** (Integer):

      Is the number of gigabytes of disk offered by the flavor.

* **ram** (Integer):

      Is the number of megabytes of RAM offered by the flavor.

* **image** (String(256)):

      Is the name of the (kernel) image corresponding to the image ID.
