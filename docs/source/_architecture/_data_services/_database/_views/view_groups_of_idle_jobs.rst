This view is one of a suite of related views used by
the VM scheduler to control the management of VMs. The suite includes:

#. view_active_resource_shortfall_

#. view_available_resources_

#. view_groups_of_idle_jobs_

#. view_idle_vms_

#. view_metadata_collation_json_

#. view_resource_contention_

The **view_groups_of_idle_jobs** is used by the VM scheduler to retrive jobs, grouped
by elegible cloud/flavors, which may require additional resources before they can be
executed. In addition to the resource requirements for jobs within the group,
each row indicates the number of idle, running completed, and held jobs
of this kind.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the CSV2 group that owns this group of
      jobs.

* **target_alias** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the alias indicating the subset of clouds within
      the group that these jobs must run on.

* **instance_type** (String(512)):

      Is the requested flavor for this group of jobs. If the value
      is NULL, no flavor was specified in the job definition and in
      this case, either a flavor default or a CSV2 automatic selection will
      be used.

* **requirements** (String(512)):

      This CSV2 generated string is passed to the HTCondor job scheduler to
      ensure the jobs runn on the appropriate VMs.

* **job_priority** (Integer):

      Is the priority assigned to all the jobs within the group of
      jobs. The lower the number the higher the priority and the earlier
      the jobs will run.

* **user** (String(512)):

      Is the used ID of the user who submitted the jobs.

* **image** (String):

      Is the name of the requested (kernel) image in the job definition.
      If none is specified, a group or cloud default iamge must be
      provided.

* **network** (String(512)):

      Is the name of the requested network in the job definition. If
      none is specified, a named network will not be requested. If a
      cloud offers more than one network to client VMs and no network
      selection is made, instantiation requests to the cloud will fail. In addition
      to request a specific network by name in the job definition, default
      network names can be specified at both the group and cloud level.

* **keep_alive** (String(512)):

      Not used.

* **max_price** (String(512)):

      Spefifies and dollars and cents, the maximum spot market bid price. A
      value greater than zero in this field indicates that a spot market
      instantiation request is to be used for these jobs. Otherwise, unconditional on
      demand instantiation reuests should be used.

* **user_data** (String(512)):

      Is a string of contextualization data to be passed to VMs. This
      field should not normally be used. Instead, users should use the metadata
      file capabilities of CSV2 to contextualize VMs.

* **job_per_core** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs from this group of jobs that can
      run on a single core.

* **request_cpus_min** (Integer):

      Is the minimum number of cores requested by any job within this
      group of jobs.

* **request_cpus_max** (Integer):

      Is the maximum number of cores requested by any job within this
      group of jobs.

* **request_cpus_total** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores requested by all the jobs in
      this group of jobs.

* **request_disk_min** (Integer):

      Is the minimum size in gigabytes of disk requested by any job
      within this group of jobs.

* **request_disk_max** (Integer):

      Is the maximum size in gigabytes of disk requested by any job
      within this group of jobs.

* **request_disk_total** (Integer):

      Is the total size in gigabytes of disk requested by all the
      jobs in this group of jobs.

* **request_ram_min** (Integer):

      Is the minimum size in kilobytes of RAM requested by any job
      within this group of jobs.

* **request_ram_max** (Integer):

      Is the maximum size in kilobytes of RAM requested by any job
      within this group of jobs.

* **request_ram_total** (Integer):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM requested by all the
      jobs in this group of jobs.

* **request_swap_min** (Integer):

      Is the minimum size in gigabytes of swap space requested by any
      job within this group of jobs.

* **request_swap_max** (Integer):

      Is the maximum size in gigabytes of swap space requested by any
      job within this group of jobs.

* **request_swap_total** (Integer):

      Is the total size in gigabytes of swap space requested by all
      the jobs in this group of jobs.

* **queue_date** (Integer):

      Is the earliest date that any job within the group of jobs
      entered the queue.

* **idle** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs of this category that are in the
      'idle' state.

* **running** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs of this category that are in the
      'running' state.

* **completed** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs of this category that are in the
      'completed' state.

* **held** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs of this category that are in the
      'held' state.

* **other** (Integer):

      Is the number of jobs of this category that are in a
      state othe than one listed above.

* **flavors** (String):

      Is a comma separated list of possible flavors capable of running these
      jobs.
