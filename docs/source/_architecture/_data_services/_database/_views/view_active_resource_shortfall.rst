This view is one of a suite of related views used by
the VM scheduler to control the management of VMs. The suite includes:

#. view_active_resource_shortfall_

#. view_available_resources_

#. view_groups_of_idle_jobs_

#. view_idle_vms_

#. view_metadata_collation_json_

#. view_resource_contention_

The **view_active_resource_shortfall** is used by the VM scheduler to determine if new
VMs should be started for each group/target_alias/target_cloud based on the total requested
resources compared with resources currently provided.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group requesting resources.

* **target_alias** (String(32)):

      Is an optional alias indicating the clouds that resources are required from.
      If this column is empty, the resources are required from any cloud
      defined within the group.

* **request_cores** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores requested by all idle (queued) and
      running jobs.

* **active_cores** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores provided.

* **shortfall_cores** (Integer):

      Is calculated by **request_cores** minus **active_cores**; a result greater then zero indicates
      that additional cores are required and VMs should be started to meet
      the shortfall.

* **request_disk** (Integer):

      Is the total size of disk requested by all idle (queued) and
      running jobs.

* **active_disk** (Integer):

      Is the total size of disk provided.

* **shortfall_disk** (Integer):

      Is calculated by **request_disk** minus **active_disk**; a result greater then zero indicates
      that additional disk is required and VMs should be started to meet
      the shortfall.

* **request_ram** (Integer):

      Is the total size of RAM requested by all idle (queued) and
      running jobs.

* **active_ram** (Integer):

      Is the total size of RAM provided.

* **shortfall_ram** (Integer):

      Is calculated by **request_ram** minus **active_ram**; a result greater then zero indicates
      that additional RAM is required and VMs should be started to meet
      the shortfall.

* **starting** (Integer):

      For information purposes only, this field indicates the number of starting VMs
      for this group/target_alias/target_cloud.

* **unregistered** (Integer):

      For information purposes only, this field indicates the number of unregistered VMs
      for this group/target_alias/target_cloud.

* **idle** (Integer):

      For information purposes only, this field indicates the number of idle VMs
      for this group/target_alias/target_cloud.

* **running** (Integer):

      For information purposes only, this field indicates the number of running VMs
      for this group/target_alias/target_cloud.
