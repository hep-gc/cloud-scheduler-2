Database Table: csv2_vms
========================

This table maintains the inventory of VMs started by CSV2. The initial
recored for a VM is created by the scheduler when it instantiates
the VM. Subsequently, the recoreds are maintained by ia variety of CSV2
processes including the scheduler, cloud pollers, User interface (UI) processes, and even
database triggers. When a VM is terminated, its' record within this table
is deleted.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning this VM.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the cloud hosting this VM.

* **vmid** (String(128)):

      Is the unique ID of the VM and is normally assignd by
      CSV2. However, when the cloud_type is "amazon", this field will contain either
      the instance ID or the request ID (spot market).


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **target_alias** (String(32)):


* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the region within the cloud where the VM is running.

* **spot_instance** (Boolean):

      This boolean value indicates whether this VM was requested using spot market
      pricing. If set to 0, a spot market pricing was not requested.
      If set to 1, a spot market pricing was requested and the
      VM is subject to termination due to market conditions.

* **instance_id** (String(64)):

      This field is normally NULL. However, when the VM is instantiated as
      a result of an "amazon" spot market request, this field will contain
      the VM instance ID.

* **cloud_type** (String(64)):

      Is the type of cloud hosting this VM.

* **vm_ips** (String(128)):

      Is a comma seperated list of fixed IP addresses assigned to the
      VM by the cloud.

* **vm_floating_ips** (String(128)):

      Is a comma seperated list of floating IP addresses assigned to the
      VM by the cloud.

* **auth_url** (String(128)):

      Is the authorization URL of the cloud hosting this VM.

* **project** (String(128)):

      Is the project used to authenticate with the cloud hosting this VM.

* **hostname** (String(128)):

      Is the short hostname of the VM.

* **keep_alive** (Integer):

      Is the number of seconds to retain this VM after it becomes
      idle.

* **start_time** (Integer):

      Is a timestamp, in epoch seconds, of when the VM start; the
      value is set by the scheduler.

* **status** (String(32)):

      Is a string indicating the current status of the VM, eg. ACTIVE,
      STARTING, ERROR, etc. For a detailed description of possible values, refer to
      the respective cloud documentation for this cloud type.

* **flavor_id** (String(128)):

      Is the ID of the flavor describing the resources assigned to this
      VM.

* **image_id** (String(128)):

      Is the ID of the (kernel) image running on the VM.

* **task** (String(32)):

      Is a string indicating the current task of the VM, eg. Spawning,
      Building, etc. When the VM is ACTIVE, this field is normally null.
      For a detailed description of possible values, refer to the respective cloud
      documentation for this cloud type.

* **power_status** (Integer):

      This field indicates the virtual power status as either "On" (1) or
      "Off" (0).

* **manual_control** (Boolean):

      This boolean field is normally set to 0 but can be toggled
      by the User Interface (UI). When set to 1, the VM is
      in manual control and is ignored by CSV2. This is normally used
      for debugging purposes to stop CSV2 terminating problematic VMs. It can be
      very useful when trying to diagnose contextualization issues.

* **htcondor_startd_errors** (String(256)):

      Is a string returned by the csv2-vm-data poller of extracted errors in
      the HTCondor logs on the VM.

* **htcondor_startd_time** (Integer):

      Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update to
      htcondor_startd_errors occurred.

* **htcondor_partitionable_slots** (Integer):

      Is the count of the currently active primary/partitionable slots on the virtual
      machine. Any value greater than zero (the count is normally 0 or
      1) indicates that the VM is registered with HTCondor. The field is
      maintained by a database trigger which detects changes to the table condor_machines.

* **htcondor_dynamic_slots** (Integer):

      Is the count of the currently active dynamic slots on the virtual
      machine. Dynamic slots are created (by HTCondor) to run a job. So,
      this count reflects the number of jobs running on the VM. If
      the count is 0, the VM is considered "idle". The field is
      maintained by a database trigger which detects changes to the table condor_machines.

* **htcondor_slots_timestamp** (Integer):

      Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update to
      either htcondor_partitionable_slots or htcondor_dynamic_slots occurred.

* **retire** (Integer):

      This control determines whether a VM is to be retired. If set
      to 0, the VM is not retired. If set greater than 0,
      then CSV2 will continue to issue retire requests to the VM until
      the VM reports a status of "Retiring". Each time a retire request
      is made, this field will be incremented by 1.

* **retire_time** (Integer):

      Deprecated.

* **terminate** (Integer):

      This control determines whether a VM is being terminated (killed). Normally, VMs
      are terminated when they have been retired (see the field "retire", above)
      and the VM is unregistered (see the field "htcondor_partitionable_slots", above). Setting this
      filed to a value greater than 1, will force the termination. If
      set greater than 0, then CSV2 will continue to issue terminate requests
      to the cloud until the VM no longer exists. Each time a
      terminate request is made, this field will be incremented by 1.

* **terminate_time** (Integer):

      Deprecated.

* **status_changed_time** (Integer):

      Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update to
      status occurred.

* **last_updated** (Integer):

      Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update occurred.

* **updater** (String(128)):

      Is a string identifying the preocess and type of update of either
      the retire or terminate fields.
