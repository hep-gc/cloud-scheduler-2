Database Table: csv2_system_status
==================================

This table maintains the status of CSV2 services and is used to
indicate the 'health' of the CSV2 system. The table has a single
row. Within this row, each service represented will have one or more
columns indicating the status of the service.

The csv2-system-status poller periodically checks the status of CSV2 services maintaining the
following fields:

* xxx_status and xxx_msg, where 'xxx' is a service name

* load

* disk, disk_size, disk_used

* ram, ram_size, ram_used

* swap, swap_size, swap_used

* last_updated

In addition, many of the services are multi-process services with a parent
process calling the CSV2 library function 'ProcessMonitor' to instantiate and monitor its
data gathering child processes. Services of this kind will have an error
count ('xxx_error_count') maintained by the parent process/ProcessMonitor which increments and decrements this
counter depending on whether child errors are observed or not during its'
monitoring cycle. Each time a child process error is observed, the count
is incremented by one. Otherwise, any count greater than zero is decremented
by one. Low counts are considered normal, since transient polling error may
arise from may sources. However, counts equal or greater than the PrcosessMonitor's
configurable 'orange_threshold' constitute a warning which are high-lighted by the User Interface
(UI).
