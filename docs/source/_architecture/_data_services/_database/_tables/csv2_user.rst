Database Table: csv2_user
=========================

This table maintains the inventory of CSV2 users. There are two kinds
of users: - super users, who can do anything (because they can
add themselves to any group). - other users, who can do nothing
unless they are added to a group.

For each user, the table contains user preferences in addition to the
authentication and authorization controls.
