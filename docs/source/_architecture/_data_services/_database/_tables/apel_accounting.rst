Database Table: apel_accounting
===============================

For each VM instantiated by CSV2 and contextualized for APEL accounting, this
table is used to accumulate accounting data during the life of the
VM. An accounting record for each VM is added by a database
trigger when the VM is instantiated. Subsequently the VM periodically reports information
such as cpu usage and network traffic via the csv2_vm_data poller interface
which updates the reporting VM's accounting record with the latest information.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      The CSV2 name of the group owning the VM.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      The short name of the cloud running the VM. This name is
      assigned by the members (users) of the when they added the cloud.

* **vmid** (String(128)):

      The VM ID assigned to the VM by the cloud.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **hostname** (String(128)):

      The short hostname of the VM. This is generally created automatically by
      CSV2.

* **cloud_type** (String(32)):

      The type of cloud the VM is running on.

* **region** (String(32)):

      The cloud's region (refer to the cloud providers documentation).

* **flavor_id** (String(128)):

      The flavor ID (instance type) employed by the VM. The flavor determines
      the resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) available to the VM.

* **image_id** (String(128)):

      The ID of the (kernel) image being used by the VM.

* **benchmark_type** (String(32)):

      A string indicating the type of benchmark being used by the VM.

* **benchmark** (Integer):

      The benchmark score achieved by the VM.

* **start_time** (Integer):

      The instantiation time of the VM in epoch seconds.

* **end_time** (Integer):

      The termination time of the VM in epoch seconds.

* **last_update** (Integer):

      The time of the last periodic update from the VM in epoch
      seconds.

* **cpu_time** (Integer):

      The total amount of the processor time used by the VM.

* **network_type** (String(32)):

      A string indicating the type of network being used by the VM
      (refer to the cloud provider documentation).

* **rx** (Integer):

      The number of megabytes of network traffic received by the VM.

* **tx** (Integer):

      The number of megabytes of network traffic sent by the VM.
