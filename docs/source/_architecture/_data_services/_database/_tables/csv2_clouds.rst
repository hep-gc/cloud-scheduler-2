Database Table: csv2_clouds
===========================

This table maintains user defined clouds for each CSV2 group. Users provide
connection details and control information, but state information is added by other
CSV2 processes.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      User specified name of the group owning this cloud resource. When adding
      new clouds, this value is set equal to the user's current group.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      User specified short name for this cloud resource. The name must be
      unique within the group.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **enabled** (Boolean):

      User specified switch indicating whether the cloud should be used (enable=1) or
      ignored (disabled=0).

* **priority** (Integer):

      User specified selection priority for starting new VMs. Lower numbers (including negative
      integers) indicate a higher priority and will be selected before other clouds
      in the group with a lower priority.

* **authurl** (String(128)):

      User specified URL of the cloud's authorization web interface. The cloud may
      provide other service endpoints, but this is the primary interface to the
      cloud.

* **project** (String(128)):

      User specified project code to be used during authentication. A "project domain"
      may also be requied (see below). Some clouds specifically require a "project
      domain ID" which is different from the project; a dedicated column is
      provided for the "project domain ID" (see below).

* **username** (String(20)):

      User specified ID to be used during authentication. A "user domain" may
      also be required (see below). Some clouds specifically require a "user domain
      ID" which is different from the username; a dedicated column is provided
      for the "user domain ID" (see below).

* **password** (String):

      User specified secret key to be used during authentication.

* **obsolete_keyname** (String(20)):

      Not used.

* **cacertificate** (String):

      An optional, user supplied certificate authority (CA) certificate bundle used to authenticate
      the cloud's SSL certificate. By default, the system CA bundle is used.
      However, if the cloud is using certificates not supported by the system
      CA bundle, this parameter is required and should point to a CA
      bundle file, readable by the cloudscheduler user and supporting the cloud's certificate.

* **region** (String(20)):

      User specified region to be used during authentication. Many clouds are hosted
      in multiple geographical locations or regions. Even when a cloud is hosted
      in a single location it will have a region specification.

* **user_domain_name** (String(20)):

      User specified user domain name. The default value is "default".

* **user_domain_id** (String(64)):

      User specified user domain ID to be used during authentication. This value
      is not normally used and should only be supplied if required by
      the cloud.

* **project_domain_name** (String(20)):

      User specified project domain name. The default value is "default".

* **project_domain_id** (String(64)):

      User specified project domain ID to be used during authentication. This value
      is not normally used and should only be supplied if required by
      the cloud.

* **cloud_type** (String(64)):

      User specified cloud type specifies the API that will be used when
      communicating with the cloud. Currently, "openstack" and "amazon" cloud types are supported.

* **ec2_owner_id** (String(32)):

      For Amazon EC2 clouds, this is EC2 owner ID automatically retrieved from
      the cloud and saved in the CSV2 cloud settings. It is used
      to identify owned versus shared resouces on that EC2 cloud.

* **communication_up** (Boolean):

      The CSV2 cloud pollers (csv2-openstack, csve-ec2, etc.) periodically polls clouds for information.
      If polling attempts are successful, this boolean will be set to 1.
      Otherwise, it is set to zero.

* **communication_rt** (Integer):

      The CSV2 cloud pollers (csv2-openstack, csve-ec2, etc.) periodically issue trivial requests to
      determine what should be a consistent request time. The reult of these
      timing tests are recoreded in milli-seconds. Fluctuations in the results could be
      the consequence of either network contention or contention on the target cloud.

* **server_meta_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **instances_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **personality_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **image_meta_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **personality_size_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **ram_ctl** (Integer):

      User specified integer control indicating the maximum amount of RAM, in kilobytes,
      that may be used on the cloud. Once this amount of RAM
      is in use by VM instances, CSV2 will not start any more
      VMs on this cloud. This parameter allows the user to limit their
      RAM usage on the cloud, to less than the cloud defined RAM
      quota. The default is -1, indicating no limit or use up to
      the quota.

* **server_groups_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **security_group_rules_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **keypairs_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **security_groups_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **server_group_members_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **floating_ips_ctl** (Integer):

      Currently not used.

* **cores_ctl** (Integer):

      User specified integer control indicating the maximum number of cores (cpus) that
      may be used on the cloud. Once this number of cores is
      in use by VM instances, CSV2 will not start any more VMs
      on this cloud. This parameter allows the user to limit their cores
      usage on the cloud, to less than the cloud defined cores quota.
      The default is -1, indicating no limit or use up to the
      quota. For a discussion of "controls" versus "quotas", see "cores_softmax" below.

* **cores_softmax** (Integer):

      User specified integer allowing the user to reduce the effective cores quota.

      Cloud quotas, unlike CSV2 controls (eg. cores_ctl, ram_ctl, etc.) cannot be exceeded.
      Attempts to ask for resources beyond a quota result in API errors.
      Resources can be used on a cloud by agents other than CSV2,
      for example, manually started VMs. CSV2 denotes all VMs started by itself
      for the current group as "native" VMs. Whereas, all other VMs are
      deemed "foreign" VMs (even those for another CSV2 group). When determining which
      limit to use, CSV2 uses the least of the "control" or the
      "sofmax" minus "foreign" or the "quota" minus "foreign". This process avoids API
      errors and ensures quotas are never exceeded.

* **spot_price** (Float):

      An optional, user defined integer specifying the maximum price, in cents, to
      bid for commercial resources. Currently, this parameter only applies to Amazon EC2
      clouds.

* **vm_boot_volume** (String(64)):


* **vm_flavor** (String(64)):

      An optional, user defined default flavor to be used when starting VMs
      on this cloud. This value overrides the value, if any, specified at
      the group level.

* **vm_image** (String(64)):

      An optional, user defined default VM image to be used when starting
      VMs on this cloud. This value overrides the value, if any, specified
      at the group level.

* **vm_keep_alive** (Integer):

      An optional, user defined integer specifying, in seconds, the "keep alive" time
      for VMs on this cloud. If VMs remain idle after completing jobs
      for longer than this time, thay will be retired/terminated. This value overrides
      the value, if any, specified at the group level.

* **vm_keyname** (String(64)):

      An optional, user defined default SSH public key name to be used
      when starting VMs on this cloud allowing the owner of the key-pair
      remote login root access to the VMs. This value overrides the value,
      if any, specified at the group level.

* **vm_network** (String(64)):

      An optional, user specified network name to be used when starting VMs
      on this cloud. This value overrides the value, if any, specified at
      the group level.

* **vm_security_groups** (String(128)):

      An optional, user specified list of security groups to be used when
      starting VMs on this cloud. This value overrides the value, if any,
      specified at the group level.

* **error_count** (Integer):

      System maintained counter indicating the number of polling errors received from the
      cloud.

* **error_time** (Integer):

      System maintained timestamp indicating the time of the last polling error received
      from the cloud.
