csv2_system_status:
    Synopsis:
        "This table maintains the status of CSV2 services and is used to indicate the 'health'\
        \ of the CSV2 system. The table has a single row. Within this row, each service\
        \ represented will have one or more columns indicating the status of the service.\n\
        The csv2-system-status poller periodically checks the status of CSV2 services maintaining\
        \ the following fields: \n* xxx_status and xxx_msg, where 'xxx' is a service name\
        \ \n* load \n* disk, disk_size, disk_used \n* ram, ram_size, ram_used \n* swap,\
        \ swap_size, swap_used \n* last_updated\nIn addition, many of the services are multi-process\
        \ services with a parent process calling the CSV2 library function 'ProcessMonitor'\
        \ to instantiate and monitor its data gathering child processes. Services of this\
        \ kind will have an error count ('xxx_error_count') maintained by the parent process/ProcessMonitor\
        \ which increments and decrements this counter depending on whether child errors\
        \ are observed or not during its' monitoring cycle. Each time a child process error\
        \ is observed, the count is incremented by one. Otherwise, any count greater than\
        \ zero is decremented by one. Low counts are considered normal, since transient\
        \ polling error may arise from may sources. However, counts equal or greater than\
        \ the PrcosessMonitor's configurable 'orange_threshold' constitute a warning which\
        \ are high-lighted by the User Interface (UI)."
