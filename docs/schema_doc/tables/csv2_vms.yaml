csv2_vms:
    Synopsis:
        This table maintains the inventory of VMs started by CSV2. The initial recored for
        a VM is created by the scheduler when it instantiates the VM. Subsequently, the
        recoreds are maintained by ia variety of CSV2 processes including the scheduler,
        cloud pollers, User interface (UI) processes, and even database triggers. When a
        VM is terminated, its' record within this table is deleted.

            Format: String(64)
            Synopsis:
                This field is normally NULL. However, when the VM is instantiated as a result of an
                "amazon" spot market request, this field will contain the VM instance ID.

            Synopsis:
                Is a string indicating the current status of the VM, eg. ACTIVE, STARTING, ERROR,
                etc. For a detailed description of possible values, refer to the respective cloud
                documentation for this cloud type.

            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                This field indicates the virtual power status as either "On" (1) or "Off" (0).
                
        manual_control:
            Format: Boolean
            Synopsis:
                This boolean field is normally set to 0 but can be toggled by the User Interface (UI).
                When set to 1, the VM is in manual control and is ignored by CSV2. This is normally
                used for debugging purposes to stop CSV2 terminating problematic VMs. It can be
                very useful when trying to diagnose contextualization issues.
                
        htcondor_startd_errors:
            Format: String(256)
            Synopsis:
                Is a string returned by the csv2-vm-data poller of extracted errors in the HTCondor
                logs on the VM.
                
        htcondor_startd_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update to htcondor_startd_errors

        htcondor_partitionable_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the count of the currently active primary/partitionable slots on the virtual machine.
                Any value greater than zero (the count is normally 0 or 1) indicates that the VM
                is registered with HTCondor. The field is maintained by a database trigger which
                detects changes to the table condor_machines.
                
        htcondor_dynamic_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the count of the currently active dynamic slots on the virtual machine. Dynamic
                slots are created (by HTCondor) to run a job. So, this count reflects the number
                of jobs running on the VM. If the count is 0, the VM is considered "idle". The field
                is maintained by a database trigger which detects changes to the table condor_machines.

                or htcondor_dynamic_slots occurred.
                
        retire:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                This control determines whether a VM is to be retired. If set to 0, the VM is not
                retired. If set greater than 0, then CSV2 will continue to issue retire requests
                to the VM until the VM reports a status of "Retiring". Each time a retire request
                is made, this field will be incremented by 1.
                
        retire_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Deprecated.
                
        terminate:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                This control determines whether a VM is being terminated (killed). Normally, VMs are
                terminated when they have been retired (see the field "retire", above) and the VM
                is unregistered (see the field "htcondor_partitionable_slots", above). Setting this
                filed to a value greater than 1, will force the termination. If set greater than
                0, then CSV2 will continue to issue terminate requests to the cloud until the VM
                no longer exists. Each time a terminate request is made, this field will be incremented
                by 1.
                
        terminate_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Deprecated.
                
        status_changed_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update to status occurred.
                
        last_updated:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is a timestamp in epoch seconds indicating when the last update occurred.
                
        updater:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is a string identifying the preocess and type of update of either the retire or terminate
                fields.
                
        image_id:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the ID of the (kernel) image running on the VM.
