apel_accounting:
    Synopsis:
        For each VM instantiated by CSV2 and contextualized for APEL accounting, this table
        is used to accumulate accounting data during the life of the VM. An accounting record
        for each VM is added by a database trigger when the VM is instantiated. Subsequently
        the VM periodically reports information such as cpu usage and network traffic via
        the csv2_vm_data poller interface which updates the reporting VM's accounting record
        with the latest information.
