condor_jobs:
    Synopsis:
        For each group defined the job poller will query the associated condor instance for
        it's complete list of jobs. It will then parse the job list and extract all valid
        csv2 jobs (jobs with a valid group_name and user combination) and insert them into
        this table. The main cloudscheduler task then uses the information in this table
        to boot appropriate virtual machines to run these jobs.
