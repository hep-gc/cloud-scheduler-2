                This boolean field is normally set to 0 but can be toggled by the User Interface (UI).
                When set to 1, the VM is in manual control and is ignored by CSV2. This is normally
                used for debugging purposes to stop CSV2 terminating problematic VMs. It can be
                very useful when trying to diagnose contextualization issues.
                
        htcondor_startd_errors:

                logs on the VM.
                
        htcondor_startd_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:

        htcondor_partitionable_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the count of the currently active primary/partitionable slots on the virtual machine.
                Any value greater than zero (the count is normally 0 or 1) indicates that the VM
                is registered with HTCondor. The field is maintained by a database trigger which
                detects changes to the table condor_machines.
                
        htcondor_dynamic_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the count of the currently active dynamic slots on the virtual machine. Dynamic
                slots are created (by HTCondor) to run a job. So, this count reflects the number
                of jobs running on the VM. If the count is 0, the VM is considered "idle". The field
                is maintained by a database trigger which detects changes to the table condor_machines.

        retire:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                This control determines whether a VM is to be retired. If set to 0, the VM is not
                retired. If set greater than 0, then CSV2 will continue to issue retire requests
                to the VM until the VM reports a status of "Retiring". Each time a retire request
                is made, this field will be incremented by 1.
                
        retire_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Deprecated.
                
        terminate:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                This control determines whether a VM is being terminated (killed). Normally, VMs are
                terminated when they have been retired (see the field "retire", above) and the VM
                is unregistered (see the field "htcondor_partitionable_slots", above). Setting this
                filed to a value greater than 1, will force the termination. If set greater than
                0, then CSV2 will continue to issue terminate requests to the cloud until the VM
                no longer exists. Each time a terminate request is made, this field will be incremented
                by 1.
                
        terminate_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Deprecated.
                
        status_changed_time:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:

                fields.

        condor_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the total number of HTCondor slots, including both partitionable and dynamic slots.
                This value has been superceded by the **htcondor_partitionable_slots** and **htcondor_dynamic_slots**
                columns and should be deprecated.

            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
