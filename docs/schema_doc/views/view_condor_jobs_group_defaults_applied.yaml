        The **view_condor_jobs_group_defaults_applied** lists all jobs together with the
        group default resource requests (cpu, disk, RAM, and swp) if the job resource requests
        are missing. This view also provides an interpretation of the **job_status** field
        appending the ''js_xxxx'' fields (see below). '
