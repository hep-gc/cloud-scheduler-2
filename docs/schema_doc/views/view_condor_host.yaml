        \ \nThe view_condor_host is used by the HTCondor machine poller when retiring Virutal\
        \ Machines (VMs) to provide contact details so that commands can be sent directly\
        \ to VMs. The view also provides slot counters to ensure that target VMs are in\
        \ an appropriate state to receive retirement commands. "
