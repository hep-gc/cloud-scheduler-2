        This view is one of a suite of related views used by the VM scheduler to control\
        \ the management of VMs. The suite includes:\n#. view_active_resource_shortfall_\n\
        #. view_available_resources_\n#. view_groups_of_idle_jobs_\n#. view_idle_vms_\n\
        #. view_metadata_collation_json_\n#. view_resource_contention_ \nThe **view_available_resources**\
        \ is used by the VM scheduler to select resources for new VMs. It presents one entry\
        \ for each flavor on each cloud that is able to start one or more VMs (ie. there\
        \ is enough available resources on the associated cloud to start at least one VM\
        \ of that flavor) together with all the information necessary to perform the initiation. "
