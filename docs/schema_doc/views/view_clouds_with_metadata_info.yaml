                User specified ID to be used during authentication. A "user domain" may also be required
                (see below). Some clouds specifically require a "user domain ID" which is different

                An optional, user supplied certificate authority (CA) certificate bundle used to authenticate
                the cloud's SSL certificate. By default, the system CA bundle is used. However,
                if the cloud is using certificates not supported by the system CA bundle, this parameter
                is required and should point to a CA bundle file, readable by the cloudscheduler
                user and supporting the cloud's certificate.
                
        region:
            Format: String(20)
            Synopsis:
                User specified region to be used during authentication. Many clouds are hosted in
                multiple geographical locations or regions. Even when a cloud is hosted in a single
                location it will have a region specification.
                
        cloud_type:
            Format: String(64)
            Synopsis:

                For Amazon EC2 clouds, this is EC2 owner ID automatically retrieved from the cloud
                and saved in the CSV2 cloud settings. It is used to identify owned versus shared
                resouces on that EC2 cloud.
                
        cores_ctl:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                User specified integer control indicating the maximum number of cores (cpus) that
                may be used on the cloud. Once this number of cores is in use by VM instances, CSV2
                will not start any more VMs on this cloud. This parameter allows the user to limit
                their cores usage on the cloud, to less than the cloud defined cores quota. The
                default is -1, indicating no limit or use up to the quota. For a discussion of "controls"
                versus "quotas", see "cores_softmax" below.
                
        cores_softmax:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                'User specified integer allowing the user to reduce the effective cores quota.
                
                Cloud quotas, unlike CSV2 controls (eg. cores_ctl, ram_ctl, etc.) cannot be exceeded.
                Attempts to ask for resources beyond a quota result in API errors. Resources can
                be used on a cloud by agents other than CSV2, for example, manually started VMs.
                CSV2 denotes all VMs started by itself for the current group as "native" VMs. Whereas,
                all other VMs are deemed "foreign" VMs (even those for another CSV2 group). When
                determining which limit to use, CSV2 uses the least of the "control" or the "sofmax"
                minus "foreign" or the "quota" minus "foreign". This process avoids API errors and
                ensures quotas are never exceeded.'

                that may be used on the cloud. Once this amount of RAM is in use by VM instances,
                CSV2 will not start any more VMs on this cloud. This parameter allows the user to
                limit their RAM usage on the cloud, to less than the cloud defined RAM quota. The
